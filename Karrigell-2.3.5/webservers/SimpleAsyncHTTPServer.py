"""An asynchronous web server

It doesn't use asyncore / asynchat to make things easier to understand 
(hopefully)

Every time a client connects to the server, the server creates
an object which will manage the dialog with the client :
read what the client has sent, write the response, then close the
connection

An asynchronous server is event-driven : with repeated calls to select()
on the sockets, the server detects which dialog managers have something to 
read and which ones can send something. Since all the sockets are 
non-blocking, the calls to select for reading simply return nothing, without
waiting for something to happen

When a dialog manager has something to read, this means that the client has
sent something. If it's a valid HTTP request, it starts with a request line,
then optional headers, and finally the end-headers sequence (\r\n\r\n)

The dialog manager is not allowed to wait until everything has been received,
it would block all the other connection. So, when it has a block of data to 
read, it buffers it until it finds the end-headers sequence. This may take 
several calls to the read() method of the socket, but as long as the client 
has not sent everything, the server will ask the dialog manager to go on 
reading

When the HTTP request has been received, the dialog manager analyses it : it
parses the first request line to see which HTTP method is used (GET or POST),
what is the URI, translates the URI into a path on the file system. All this
is done in the modules BaseHTTPServer and SimpleHTTPServer in the standard 
library. The request headers are also parsed and stored

Once this is done, the response is ready to be sent to the client. As before,
the dialog manager cannot block the connection to send everything : if the
response is a very big file to download, all the other clients would have to
wait until the file has been sent

So here again the response must be sent piece by piece ; every time the dialog
manager has control, it sends the next piece, and so on until the whole 
response has been sent to the client

To achieve this, the dialog manager holds the response pieces in a list of 
file-like "sources" : StringIO's for the response line and headers, and the 
file object matching the URI if one has been found. When the next source is
None, the dialog manager knows that the whole response has been sent : it
closes the connection and the server removes the dialog manager from its
dictionary

One more thing about POST requests : after the request line and headers have
been received, the dialog manager must go on reading until it has received
a number of bytes specified by the Content-Length header. If the length is too
long to be buffered in memory, a temporary file is created to store the data
before it is parsed by cgi.FieldStorage
